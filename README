SHIBUI
=========================================

Fairly basic hashmap implementation built on top of an async TCP server
featuring epoll, a toy project just for learning purpose.

The project is a minimal redis-like implementation with a text based protocol,
currently supports basic operations:

- SET key value
- GET key
- DEL key
- INC key
- DEC key
- SUB key
- PUB key value
- COUNT
- QUIT/EXIT

All commands are case insensitive, so not strictly uppercase. Shibui can be used
as a basic message broker through commands PUB/SUB to pulish messages to
multiple subscriber, using a key as a topic.
Shibui server expect an optional arg to set an arbitrary host to listen on port
6373, otherwise localhost will be automatically set.
Actually there's no client console so it can be tested using a generic tcp
client like telnet or netcat.

* TODO

- Persistence on disk, maybe through logging
- CLI to send commands and format output
- Additional commands
- Distribution system (fairly hard)
