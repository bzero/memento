SHIBUI
=========================================

Fairly basic hashmap/message queue implementation built on top of an async TCP
server to handle multiple clients connections featuring epoll, and consistent
hashing data distribution, a toy project just for learning purpose.

The project is a minimal redis-like implementation with a text based protocol,
currently supports basic operations:

- SET key value               sets <key> to <value>
- GET key                     get the value identified by <key>
- DEL key                     delete value identified by <key>
- INC key                     increment by 1 the value idenfied by <key>
- DEC key                     decrement by 1 the value idenfied by <key>
- SUB key                     subscribe to <key>, receiving messages published
- UNSUB key                   unsubscriber to <key>
- PUB key value               publish message <value> to <key> (analog to set
                              but broadcasting to all subscribed members of key)
- KEYS                        list all keys stored into the keyspace
- VALUES                      list all values stored into the keyspace
- COUNT                       return the number of key-value pair stored
- TAIL key offset             like SUB, but with an <offset> representing how
                              many messages discard starting from 0 (the very
                              first chronologically)
- PREFSCAN key_prefix         scan the keyspace finding all values associated to
                              keys matching <key_prefix> as prefix
- FUZZYSCAN pattern           scan the keyspace finding all values associated to
                              keys matching <pattern> in a fuzzy search way
- SUM key1 key2 ..            sum integer value inside key1 to key2 to keyN,
                              ignoring values with no integer value
- FLUSH                       delete all maps stored inside partitions
- QUIT/EXIT                   close connection

All commands are case insensitive, so not strictly uppercase. Shibui can be used
as a basic message broker through commands PUB/SUB to publish messages to
multiple subscriber, using a key as a topic.
Shibui server expect an optional arg to set an arbitrary host to listen on port
6373, otherwise localhost will be automatically set.
Actually there's no client console so it can be tested using a generic tcp
client like telnet or netcat.

Out of the common commands like SET, GET or COUNT who everyone probably knows
the behavior, TAIL key number is a command that allow a client to consume an
arbitrary number of chronologically sorted messages published to a specific key,
with number as the offset for the depletion. 0 means from the start of the
publication, increasing number discard the same quantity of messages starting
from the oldest going to younger. E.g:

pub topic_key i am
pub topic_key a stream
pub topic_key of useless
pub topic_key messages

tail topic_key 0 ->
i am
a stream
of useless
messages

tail topic_key 2 ->
of useless
messages

All subsequent messages published to the key topic will be normally dispatched
like a normal SUB command.

Actually the keyspace is distributed across 1024 partitions based on consistent
hashing of the keys, this way should be simplier to eventually distribute data
across multiple nodes.

* BUILD
=========================================

To build the source just run make. A shibui executable will be generated that
can be started to listen on localhost:6737, ready to receive commands from any
TCP client.

* TODO
=========================================

- Persistence on disk, maybe through logging
- CLI to send commands and format output
- Additional commands
- Distribution system (fairly hard)
